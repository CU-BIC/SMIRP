./progs/HeteroMirPred/miPred/bioperl-1.4/t/data/interpro_short.xml:Steroid or nuclear hormone receptors (4A nuclear receptor, NRs) constitute an important superfamily of transcription regulators that are involved in widely diverse physiological functions, including control of embryonic development, cell differentiation and homeostasis. Members of the superfamily include the steroid hormone receptors and receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoids, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 and a variety of other ligands. The proteins function as dimeric molecules in nuclei to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner <cite idref="PUB00004464"/>, <cite idref="PUB00006168"/>. In addition to C-terminal ligand-binding domains, these nuclear receptors contain a highly-conserved, N-terminal zinc-finger that mediates specific binding to target DNA sequences, termed ligand-responsive elements. In the absence of ligand, steroid hormone receptors are thought to be weakly associated with nuclear components; hormone binding greatly increases receptor affinity.
./progs/HeteroMirPred/miPred/bioperl-1.4/t/data/interpro_short.xml:NRs are extremely important in medical research, a large number of them being implicated in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hormone resistance syndromes, etc. While several NRs act as ligand-inducible transcription factors, many do not yet have a defined ligand and are accordingly termed "orphan" receptors. During the last decade, more than 300 NRs have been described, many of which are orphans, which cannot easily be named due to current nomenclature confusions in the literature. However, a new system has recently been introduced in an attempt to rationalise the increasingly complex set of names used to describe superfamily members.

./progs/HuntMi/progs/miPred/bioperl-1.4/t/data/interpro_short.xml:Steroid or nuclear hormone receptors (4A nuclear receptor, NRs) constitute an important superfamily of transcription regulators that are involved in widely diverse physiological functions, including control of embryonic development, cell differentiation and homeostasis. Members of the superfamily include the steroid hormone receptors and receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoids, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 and a variety of other ligands. The proteins function as dimeric molecules in nuclei to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner <cite idref="PUB00004464"/>, <cite idref="PUB00006168"/>. In addition to C-terminal ligand-binding domains, these nuclear receptors contain a highly-conserved, N-terminal zinc-finger that mediates specific binding to target DNA sequences, termed ligand-responsive elements. In the absence of ligand, steroid hormone receptors are thought to be weakly associated with nuclear components; hormone binding greatly increases receptor affinity.
./progs/HuntMi/progs/miPred/bioperl-1.4/t/data/interpro_short.xml:NRs are extremely important in medical research, a large number of them being implicated in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hormone resistance syndromes, etc. While several NRs act as ligand-inducible transcription factors, many do not yet have a defined ligand and are accordingly termed "orphan" receptors. During the last decade, more than 300 NRs have been described, many of which are orphans, which cannot easily be named due to current nomenclature confusions in the literature. However, a new system has recently been introduced in an attempt to rationalise the increasingly complex set of names used to describe superfamily members.

./progs/microPred/progs/miPred/bioperl-1.4/t/data/interpro_short.xml:Steroid or nuclear hormone receptors (4A nuclear receptor, NRs) constitute an important superfamily of transcription regulators that are involved in widely diverse physiological functions, including control of embryonic development, cell differentiation and homeostasis. Members of the superfamily include the steroid hormone receptors and receptors for thyroid hormone, retinoids, 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 and a variety of other ligands. The proteins function as dimeric molecules in nuclei to regulate the transcription of target genes in a ligand-responsive manner <cite idref="PUB00004464"/>, <cite idref="PUB00006168"/>. In addition to C-terminal ligand-binding domains, these nuclear receptors contain a highly-conserved, N-terminal zinc-finger that mediates specific binding to target DNA sequences, termed ligand-responsive elements. In the absence of ligand, steroid hormone receptors are thought to be weakly associated with nuclear components; hormone binding greatly increases receptor affinity.
./progs/microPred/progs/miPred/bioperl-1.4/t/data/interpro_short.xml:NRs are extremely important in medical research, a large number of them being implicated in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hormone resistance syndromes, etc. While several NRs act as ligand-inducible transcription factors, many do not yet have a defined ligand and are accordingly termed "orphan" receptors. During the last decade, more than 300 NRs have been described, many of which are orphans, which cannot easily be named due to current nomenclature confusions in the literature. However, a new system has recently been introduced in an attempt to rationalise the increasingly complex set of names used to describe superfamily members.

No further meeting to discuss\nquotas was set, delegates said.\n    Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the\nInternational Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after\nprices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.\n    With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer\nselling initially and a price war among commercial coffee\nroasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.\n    Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket\nshelf this spring, coffee dealers said.\n    The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and\nexporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the\nbreakdown of the talks.\n    Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and\ndelegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council\nadjourned, \"A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not\nprepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective\ncriteria.\n    \"We want to insure that countries receive export quotas\nbased on their ability to supply the market, instead of their\npolitical influence in the ICO.\"\n    Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster\ncountered, \"Negotiations failed because consumers tried to\ndictate quotas, not negotiate them.\"\n    Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts\nexported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market\nof about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted\nquotas to continue under this basic scheme.\n    But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers\nproposed carving up the export market on the basis of\nexportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil\'s\nshare to 28.8 pct.\n    Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes\nin many countries\' export capabilities and make coffee more\nreadily available to consumers when they need it.\n    A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest\nexporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim\nproposal could not bring the two sides together.\n    Delegates speculated Brazil\'s financial problems,\nillustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on\nbank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to\nprotect its coffee export earnings.\n    Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily\non coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and\nColombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO\'s failure\nto agree quotas, analysts said.\n    The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as\nmuch as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates\nforecast.\n    The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full\ncouncil is not due to meet again until September, delegates\nsaid.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed\nat the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it\nis time to go and sell coffee.\"\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans\nto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next\nmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade\nsources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a\nprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public\nselling tenders for coffee bought on London\'s futures market\nlast year.\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\nmarket \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months.\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\nfuture quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\nDauster said.\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\n    It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\ndifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\naccept the producers\' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\n    \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\nsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\nthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\nOctober are unlikely, while Brazil\'s Dauster noted the ICO has\ncontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\n    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\nby importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\nhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\nnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could\nshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.\n    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the\nseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to\nlapse should lasting agreement not be found.\n    \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their\nfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient\nand we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

The consumer position would have in effect reduced the\nmarket share of Brazil, by far the world\'s largest producer.\n    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support\nlegislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.\ncustoms service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply\nwith any future coffee quotas.\n    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the\ncoffee policy situation following the collapse of the London\ntalks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\"\n    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee\npolicy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market\noffensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,\nto soften the consumer position.\n    \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will\nkind of want to test the resolve of other producers and\nconsumers,\" said one U.S. official.\n    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said\nBrazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few\nmonths in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other\ncountries, particularly the splinter group of small producers\nwho differed with the major producers in London.\n    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin\nAmerican countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the\nU.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in\nthe White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.\nofficials said.\n    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee\npolicy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from\npolitically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.\nofficials said.\n    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia\nat the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on\nobjective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica\njoined the splinter group, which said it would agree to\nobjective criteria.\n    There is a strong feeling among some in the State\nDepartment that the United States should continue to support\nthe splinter group of producers who have taken the\npolitically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective\ncriteria question, U.S. officials said.\n    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be\nsome pressure to reassess positions.\n    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the\nNetherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on\nthe issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.\n    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations\nto successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.\n    However, U.S. sources said West Germany\'s support was at\ntimes qualified and there is some concern that the European\nCommunity could come under pressure to be more accommodative to\nproducers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and\nother African producers during the talks.\n    A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,\nalthough not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.\n    While political manuevering by small producers and\nconsuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the\nkey to any future outcome will be Brazil\'s position.\n    U.S. officials blamed Brazil\'s intransigence for the\nfailure of the talks and said a more flexible position from\nBrasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

Analysts\nagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they \ndiffered sharply over the carmaker\'s long term prospects.\n    \"I\'m very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder\nPeabody and Co. \"They\'re clearly committed to enhancing\nshareholder value.\"\n    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the\nbuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to\nrecapture lost market share.\n    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy\nback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The\nannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,\nwith more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.\n    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the\nstock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at\nleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a\ngood performance expected from new car models.\n    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the\nrepurchase program is not a positive.\n    \"The buyback doesn\'t really change the earnings outlook and\nputs more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will\nhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock\nshould settle back down to around 76, he added.\n    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and\n5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.\nHealy\'s numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,\nwhich range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four\ndlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.\n    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM\'s share of the domestic\ncar and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are\nnot selling as well as their competitors,\" he said.\n    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the\nyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and\nChrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases.

The numbers include imports.\n    Kidder Peabody\'s Kirnan said cost reductions and product\nimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the\nfourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.\n    \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it\'s rolling up\nits sleeves and getting serious. I think there\'s a major\nearnings surprise in the winds,\" he said.\n    Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in\npart in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning\n5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more\nconcerned than ever about improving their relative valuation\nwith respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said.\n    Another positive for the stock is GM\'s dividend, currently\nfive dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than\nits competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash\ndividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.\n    But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\nsaid U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM\'s new products, if\nsuccessful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its\nmarket share.\n    \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will\nonly curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around\n35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.\n    Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle\nof the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he\nsaid results will not improve until 1988.\n    \"I\'m not looking for improvement this year.

./progs/weka-3-6-9/data/ReutersCorn-train.arff:'NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the\nyen\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact\nthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major\nEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate\ndistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.\n    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements\nby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the\ncurrency movements of the past two years are also creating a\nfundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new\ntrade tensions and imbalances.\n    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are\nalready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-\nEuropean Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.\n    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international\ncooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between\nthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down\nthe value of the dollar was a historic one.\n    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major\ncurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which\nthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not\nnecessarily central significance, the officials said.\n    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took\nplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar\'s peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don\'t expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\nand this year we may have to do so again,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

Some of them are \"too sophisticated to\nconvert into financial terms,\" one banking source said.\n    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is\nimpossible to calculate.\n    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland\'s\neconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.\n    \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-\nachieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only\ncontributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said.\n    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured\nNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation\nfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under\nmartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was\noriginally devised several years ago by the Institute of\nNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planning\ncommission.\n    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish\neconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth\ntrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in\ncredits from Western commercial and government lenders.\n    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was\nbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing\nthe estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point,\nwhich has no real scientific evaluation.\"\n    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to\nthe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs\nannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were\nimposed.\n    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to\n200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade\nsurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs\nagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.\n    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important\nU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,\nchemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits\ndried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is\naccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for\npolitical reasons,\" said one expert. \"It\'s an illusion based on a\nmisunderstanding of Western economy.\"\n    \"There\'s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone\nwho has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that\nPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits\nin the 1970s which were no longer today\'s reality.\n    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one\ndiplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders\nand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of\nscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the\nlifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact\non Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs\nand lacks the means to modernise its industry.\n    \"MFN doesn\'t really mean anything, only that Poland will not\nbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to\nregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are\nin play now,\" said one Western envoy.\n    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their\nquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist\nmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper\nPoland\'s efforts to regain entry.\n    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised\nthis fact recently.\n    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making\nup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly\ndifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of\ntwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level of\nexports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\"\n    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it\nhas a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says\nimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said\n\"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing\nof the Polish economy won\'t cut any ice. The Americans will\njust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing\nSolidarity.\"\n    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in\ntalks in Washington last week with the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was\nlooking for a lead from the United States.\n    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its\nfinancial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short\ntime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its\nforeign economic partners.\"\n    He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to\nplay a part in the cooperative policy of Poland\'s partners\ninterested in the settlement of Polish debt.\"\n    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed\nWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and\nParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and\nsaid it should now play a more positive role.\n    \"As a major superpower the United States can influence\ninternational organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings\naimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to\nwhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

./progs/weka-3-6-9/data/ReutersCorn-train.arff:'NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the\nyen\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact\nthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major\nEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate\ndistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.\n    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements\nby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the\ncurrency movements of the past two years are also creating a\nfundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new\ntrade tensions and imbalances.\n    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are\nalready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-\nEuropean Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.\n    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international\ncooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between\nthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down\nthe value of the dollar was a historic one.\n    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major\ncurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which\nthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not\nnecessarily central significance, the officials said.\n    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took\nplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar\'s peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don\'t expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance.

This is when, traditionally, there is more demand\nfor gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s.\n    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela\nand Indonesia were having less problems with output than\nproducers like his own country because they exported oil\nproducts.\n    Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opec\npricing system, he said.\n    Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift\nsome Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks\nand ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventually\nhave to buy Opec oil.\n    \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)\nthey will realise they should buy now instead of paying more\nlater on,\" he said.\n    Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being\npressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was\nimportant to know that terms with them were negotiable,\nflexible and under constant review, not only when the market\nseemed weak.\n    He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation\nministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that\nsuch a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority\nfor Opec at the moment.\n    \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said.\n\"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is\nworking, not dealing with a differential of cents between\ngrades.\"\n    But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over\nthe differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

The question is\ntherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.\n    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe\nLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see the\ntrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. \"Even after this action\nover the last few weeks, sterling\'s only just within striking\ndistance of that range,\" he said.\n    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some\nbroad target range around this area.\n    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the\npound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of\na loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.\n    \"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they\nare, what\'s to stop it (going higher),\" said John Cox, executive\ndirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London\nforeign exchange market.\n    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active\nselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of\ngeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helped\nkeep it below 1.60 dlrs.\n    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and\n1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.\n    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling\nheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it\nholds around these levels.\n    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest\nrate boat. \"If rates don\'t come down, the market will say they\nought to have come down and will sell sterling,\" he said.\n    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of \"hot money\" being\ninvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight\nor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short\nnotice.\n    However, the authorities will hope that at least a\nproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.\n    \"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and\nhave to jack them back up again,\" said Richard Jeffrey,\neconomist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.\n    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for\nsterling, at least in the near term.\n    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point\nabout March 17, Budget Day.\n    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the\nBudget, said Temperton.\n    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the\nrun-up to a general election, the major factor behind current\nbullishness in the government bond and currency markets.\n    \"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.\nHe wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate\ncut,\" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the\nequities arm of Mercury International Group.\n    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the\nway lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in\nthe weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last\nFriday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.\n    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11\n3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest\nsince base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.\n    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months\nmoney, banking sources said the market could not take the cut\nas a guide to the Bank\'s intentions on short term rates.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

But the government has repeatedly said it\nwill not allow any banks to go under.\n    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of\nproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether\ndebtors have regular cash flows or not.\n    Banks\' shareholders and depositors will have their rights\nguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance\nin a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector\nis the biggest after oil.\n    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride\nout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.\n    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)\ncompared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last\nyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.\n    But strategic diversification into downstream operations in\nEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment at\nhome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell\nover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.\n    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average\n2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed\nproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as\ncrude.\n    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason\nfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic\ninflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent\nyears and signs government spending on productive sectors will\nremain steady.\n    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8\nbillion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below\nthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit\nGulf.\n    Kuwait\'s petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put\nofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income\nof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.\n    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these\nreserves may not be enough to prevent a \"real\" budget deficit for\nthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.\n    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,\nrevenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,\ndoubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.\n    This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded\nin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at\nup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some\nshortfall.\n    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for\neconomic growth this year or next.\n    \"It depends on oil prices,\" one said. \"This summer is\nimportant.\"\n    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday\nthe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state\nspending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the\neconomy.\n    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be\nspelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

The\ncompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\nrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n    Heineken\'s Spanish activities should start yielding profit\nnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\nalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\nEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\ninto the closed West German market -- Europe\'s biggest beer\nmarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\nhave the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\npoint,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\nhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n    \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\nmarket, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\nwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\ntaste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\nregionalized.\n     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\nAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\nimportant beer growth markets in the long term.\n     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\nmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\nhampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\nper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\nand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n1986 sales.\n    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\nof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\nhave been looking at other possibilities.\n    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\nthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\nhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\nmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\npopular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\npossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n    Chairman Heineken said the company\'s seven year efforts to\npenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\ncontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken\'s\nmarket potential.

But Volcker\nhas warned that a further fall in the dollar\'s value is fraught\nwith danger.\n    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\nimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\ncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\n    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\nmajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\nthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\nshould be stabilized at around current levels.\n    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\ntake steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\nagreed to cut its budget deficit.\n    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\nway to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\nto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\n    \"If you don\'t deal with the budget deficit, everything else\nyou do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent\ntestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\ngovernment\'s purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\nsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\nto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\nStates.\n    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\ncurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\n    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\nthat any deficit reduction was better than none.\n    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \nnot enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\nneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\nfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.\n    \"There\'s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\nyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\nFed\'s flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\nis, it\'s not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.\n    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government\'s\nmost vexing and persistent problems.\n    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\nlittle indication that this year\'s figure will be any lower,\nthough administration officials have predicted it will drop by\nabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year\'s end.\n    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\nworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\nfederal budget.\n    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\nattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\nthe 1986-1991 period by last year\'s Gramm-Rudman balanced\nbudget law.\n    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\nnext year\'s federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\nCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\nshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\n    \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\nmost you\'re going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,\nsaid Touche Ross\'s Collander. \"To do something more than that\nwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"\n    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\nshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\n    \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable\nreduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now\nlook like a failure to Wall Street.\"\n    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would\nlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year\nbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting\ndefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their\nanticipated spending levels for next year.\n    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of\nnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new \ntaxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

He added that West German growth forecasts would\nhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop\nto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.\n    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets\nhad parted company with transactions in goods, services and\ninvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that\ndetermined market trends.\n    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to\ngrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates\nwould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.\n    \"In other words, the monetary policy measures required are\ndifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --\nthose needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of\nmounting economic activity,\" Koehler said.\n    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.\nCurrent account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation\ngoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.\n    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep\nrise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost\nof European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports\nto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\nmake itself felt compared with the price effect.\n    \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\nfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current account\nover the medium term,\" Koehler said.\n    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\nonly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\nIn Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\nrise faster than GNP.\n    \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\n    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\nprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\nan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\n    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\ndifferential would Europe and Japan look for financial\ninvestment in the U.S.\n    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\nhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\nmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\n    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\nby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\ninterest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\nand its substantial impact on exchange rates.\n    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\nprice stability, economic growth and full employment but also\nto tackle international problems like the exchange rate\nproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\n    A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\nof non-inflationary economic growth in an international\nmonetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\n    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\nnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\nto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\nthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,\nbecause they were only testing points for the market, he said.\n    In order to keep the international monetary system free of\ndisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\nalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

Recognized the importance\nof MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of\nthe influential political group, he added.\n    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to\nthe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the\nPostal Savings System, analysts said.\n    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate\ninterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial\nliberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal\nSavings System\'s ability to offer slightly higher rates than\nbanks, they said.\n    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT\'s\nobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized\nthe ministry as feudal.\n    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting\ncompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under its\nwing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest\nprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.\n    But many of the ministry\'s actions are not unlike those of\nits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world\nincluding Britain, several analysts said.\n    \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said.\n\"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order\nin utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable\nview,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

Although the company said it would meet\ncommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.\n    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes\nper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks\nand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the\nU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and\na regular supplier to the world market.\n    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,\nhave been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.\n    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up\nquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported\nin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the\nfirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying\norder was filled by merchants in March.\n    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices\nthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and\nestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three months\ndelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\nGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\na target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\n    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\nand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\nand this is believed to be in strong hands.\n    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\nlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\nwhich are not popular with merchants putting together\nshipments.\n    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\nthe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to\nsecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies\naffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on\nthe transport of used batteries.\n    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important\npart in determining the direction of prices, with contracts\nexpiring end-April at Cominco\'s Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,\nMine/smelter and at Doe Run\'s Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.\n    Noranda\'s New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract\nexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of\nstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.\n    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting\nspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current\nfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium\nto 20 from four.

If there had been\nno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.\"\n    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson\nsaid, \"the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode\n... but one has to be vigilant.\"\n    He said yesterday\'s G-7 statement, which affirmed that\n\"current levels\" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been\n\"carefully worded.\" \"We know what we mean, and we all mean the\nsame thing,\" he said.\n    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese\nmeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of\nweakness for that agreement.\n    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa\'s\npresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate\ndomestic demand.\n    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate\nincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the package\nalso involved a second stage to increase expenditures during\nthe second half of this year.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
./progs/weka-3-6-9/data/ReutersGrain-test.arff:'TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES Steel stocks, which have had a healthy\nrunup recently, still present some short term investment\nopportunities, according to some steel analysts.\n    But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm\nprices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end\nsoon. They recommend taking profits.\n    \"It\'s that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,\" said\nCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. \"Orders will be\nstrong for about two months, and there are signs that some\n(order rates) are starting to dive already.\"\n    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees\nsome short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp\n&lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel\nIndustries Inc &lt;IAD>.\n    \"There is still some attractiveness to steels over the\nshort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and\nrising prices,\" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,\nhowever, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to\nmake them more efficient.\n    Despite his bearishness, Merrill\'s Bradford continues to\nrecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.\n    Armco\'s steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance\nsheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business\nhas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford\nnoted. \"It\'s not a high-quality investment situation yet but\nthey\'ve come a long way,\" he said.\n    \"We think the stock will do moderately better than the\nmarket,\" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,\ncould go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.\n    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,\nbefore special gains from recouped investment tax credits,\nagainst losses last year.\n    Armco\'s 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he\nsaid.\n    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. \"We had a buy\non it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have\nit,\" he said.\n    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a\nshare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and\nfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. \"But a lot\ndepends on oil prices,\" he added. About 60 pct of USX\'s sales\ncome from oil and natural gas.\n    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of\nSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. \"The company\'s done a lot\n(of restructuring), more than the market\'s given them credit\nfor,\" she said.\n    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was\ntrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a\nshare this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in\n1986.\n    Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has\nbeen recommending the stocks since last November.\n    Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group\nalthough he said the earnings outlook is improved through the\nthird quarter.\n    But he sees potential trouble beyond then. \"I think (steel)\nprices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,\"\nhe said.\n    Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal\ndropoff later in the year. \"But there are more positives than\nnegatives,\" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic\nindustry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should\ncause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

Normally\nwhen an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of\nbeef exports,\" one industry source said yesterday.\n     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, \"Depending on the\nseriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then\ndecides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting\nbeef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension\non exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are\nstill awaiting their decision,\" he added, asking not to be\nidentified.\n    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of\nhigh-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had\nspent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and\nupgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.\n    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be\nforced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low\nprices, the source said.

But other businessmen said such\na short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by\nfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.\n    \"That is a very short-term view,\" said Lawrence Mills,\ndirector-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.\n    \"If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will\nbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong\nis the disadvantage of action restraining trade,\" he said.\n    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong\'s biggest export market,\naccounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.\n    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade\ntalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,\nIndustry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.\n    \"This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two\ncountries which are major trading partners of ours is a very\nserious matter,\" Button said.\n    He said Australia\'s concerns centred on coal and beef,\nAustralia\'s two largest exports to Japan and also significant\nU.S. Exports to that country.\n    Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the\ntrade stand-off continue.\n    Japan\'s ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined\na package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.\n    The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget\nand record public works spending in the first half of the\nfinancial year.\n    They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency\nmeasure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister\nYasuhiro Nakasone\'s avowed fiscal reform program.\n    Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto\nKuroda, Japan\'s deputy minister of International Trade and\nIndustry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an\neffort to end the dispute.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has\nbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year\nbeef accord next March 31.\n    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales\nfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports\nfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although\nthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.\n    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its\nbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain\nimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.\n    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when\nUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has\nthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.\nAgricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing\nsome one billion dlrs in new business.\n    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import\ncontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,\npurees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,\nprepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.\n    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan\'s\ntop business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove\nresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.\n    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional\nreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue\nshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the\nindustrial sector.\n    \"Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these\nissues should not be discussed on the same table,\" the official\nsaid.\n REUTER\n&#3;',1

./progs/weka-3-6-9/data/ReutersCorn-test.arff:'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY Kuwait\'s oil-reliant and debt-ridden\neconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices\nwill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists\nsay.\n    Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold\noil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the\nnorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.\n    Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross\ndomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year\nafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.\n    This was after taking into account inflation in consumer\nprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.\n    Factors depressing economic activity include the\n6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait\'s doorstep, which\nthreatens the emirate\'s vital oil export lifeline through the\nGulf and has sapped business confidence.\n    But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September\nwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis\ncaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive\nnew debt settlement program was introduced.\n    The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward\ntrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.\n    The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer\nspending, thus generating an informal credit system.\n    Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are\nstill owed by individuals and companies.\n    There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)\nin outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which\none-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as\nbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it\nwill not allow any banks to go under.\n    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of\nproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether\ndebtors have regular cash flows or not.\n    Banks\' shareholders and depositors will have their rights\nguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance\nin a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector\nis the biggest after oil.\n    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride\nout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.\n    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)\ncompared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last\nyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.\n    But strategic diversification into downstream operations in\nEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment at\nhome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell\nover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.\n    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average\n2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed\nproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as\ncrude.\n    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason\nfor cautious optimism.

The\ncompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in\nrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.\n    Heineken\'s Spanish activities should start yielding profit\nnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had\nalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.\n    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the\nEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer\ninto the closed West German market -- Europe\'s biggest beer\nmarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. \"We\nhave the beer, but distribution and sales is the important\npoint,\" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken\nhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.\n    \"The question is not if we want to penetrate the German\nmarket, but how we are to do it,\" van Schaik said, adding that\nwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a\ntaste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very\nregionalized.\n     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for\nAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most\nimportant beer growth markets in the long term.\n     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with\nmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was\nhampered by the lack of hard currencies there.\n    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters\nper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions\nand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total\n1986 sales.\n    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price\nof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists\nhave been looking at other possibilities.\n    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on\nthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which\nhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.\n    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw\nmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were\npopular in Rwanda . \"This is a possibility, but we could not\npossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,\" Coebergh said.\n    Chairman Heineken said the company\'s seven year efforts to\npenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a\ncontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.\n    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken\'s\nmarket potential.

But Volcker\nhas warned that a further fall in the dollar\'s value is fraught\nwith danger.\n    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as\nimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign\ncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.\n    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other\nmajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of\nthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates\nshould be stabilized at around current levels.\n    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to\ntake steps to stimulate their economies and the United States\nagreed to cut its budget deficit.\n    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a\nway to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is\nto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.\n    \"If you don\'t deal with the budget deficit, everything else\nyou do is going to be counterproductive,\" Volcker said in recent\ntestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.\n    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the\ngovernment\'s purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit\nsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or\nto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United\nStates.\n    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the\ncurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.\n    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed\nthat any deficit reduction was better than none.\n    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were \nnot enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it\nneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar\nfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.\n    \"There\'s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if\nyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the\nFed\'s flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer\nis, it\'s not enough,\" Silvia told Reuters.\n    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government\'s\nmost vexing and persistent problems.\n    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet\nlittle indication that this year\'s figure will be any lower,\nthough administration officials have predicted it will drop by\nabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year\'s end.\n    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep\nworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the\nfederal budget.\n    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not\nattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for\nthe 1986-1991 period by last year\'s Gramm-Rudman balanced\nbudget law.\n    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for\nnext year\'s federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget\nCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fall\nshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.\n    \"For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the\nmost you\'re going to get\" out of Congress at the present time,\nsaid Touche Ross\'s Collander. \"To do something more than that\nwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.\"\n    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up\nshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.\n    \"To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable\nreduction level,\" he explained. \"Anything less than that will now\nlook like a failure to Wall Street.\"\n    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would\nlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year\nbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting\ndefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their\nanticipated spending levels for next year.\n    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of\nnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new \ntaxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

But the volume effect of falling imports\nto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to\nmake itself felt compared with the price effect.\n    \"Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going\nfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current account\nover the medium term,\" Koehler said.\n    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur\nonly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.\nIn Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should\nrise faster than GNP.\n    \"In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,\" Koehler said.\n    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be\nprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by\nan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..\n    But only if there was an appropriate interest rate\ndifferential would Europe and Japan look for financial\ninvestment in the U.S.\n    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank\nhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its\nmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.\n    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates\nby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading\ninterest rates because of the signal this gives to the market\nand its substantial impact on exchange rates.\n    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of\nprice stability, economic growth and full employment but also\nto tackle international problems like the exchange rate\nproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.\n    A strategy had to be designed that helped \"the safeguarding\nof non-inflationary economic growth in an international\nmonetary system largely free of disruptions,\" Koehler said.\n    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was\nnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed\nto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over\nthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,\nbecause they were only testing points for the market, he said.\n    In order to keep the international monetary system free of\ndisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but\nalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

Recognized the importance\nof MPT,\" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of\nthe influential political group, he added.\n    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to\nthe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the\nPostal Savings System, analysts said.\n    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate\ninterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial\nliberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal\nSavings System\'s ability to offer slightly higher rates than\nbanks, they said.\n    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT\'s\nobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized\nthe ministry as feudal.\n    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting\ncompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under its\nwing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest\nprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.\n    But many of the ministry\'s actions are not unlike those of\nits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world\nincluding Britain, several analysts said.\n    \"The United States is really the odd man out,\" Abegglen said.\n\"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order\nin utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable\nview,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

Although the company said it would meet\ncommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.\n    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes\nper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks\nand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the\nU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and\na regular supplier to the world market.\n    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,\nhave been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.\n    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up\nquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported\nin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the\nfirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying\norder was filled by merchants in March.\n    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices\nthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and\nestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three months\ndelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in\nGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often\na target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.\n    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp\nand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,\nand this is believed to be in strong hands.\n    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest\nlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses\nwhich are not popular with merchants putting together\nshipments.\n    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since\nthe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to\nsecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies\naffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on\nthe transport of used batteries.\n    Labour negotiations in North America will play an important\npart in determining the direction of prices, with contracts\nexpiring end-April at Cominco\'s Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,\nMine/smelter and at Doe Run\'s Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.\n    Noranda\'s New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract\nexpiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of\nstrikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.\n    Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting\nspeculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current\nfirmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium\nto 20 from four.

./progs/weka-3-6-9/data/ReutersCorn-test.arff:'CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY Canada\'s trade picture has brightened\nconsiderably, underscoring economists\' predictions the sector\nwould post a long awaited recovery this year.\n    The federal government reported today that the monthly\nsurplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,\ndouble January\'s 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than\nFebruary 1986\'s 189 mln dlr tally.\n    \"Hopefully it\'s the beginning of a trend,\" said Richardson\nGreenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.\n    Economists generally don\'t expect such large gains over the\nnext months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the\nyear.\n    \"We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the\nyear, and it certainly looks as if this morning\'s figure is\nindicative of that,\" commented economist James Donegan at the\nToronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.\n    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23\npct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion\ndls in the month.\n    \"Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of\nexports up by 5.9 pct in February,\" the agency said in its\nmonthly report.\n    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85\nbillion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion\ndlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.\n    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end\nup three to five billion dlrs higher than last year\'s dismal\n10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion\ndlrs.\n    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched\noff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85\nU.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after\nclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.\n    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early\nafternoon trading.\n    Economists have been banking on an improved trade\nperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish\nCanadian economy.\n    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched\noff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85\nU.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after\nclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.\n    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early\nafternoon trading.\n    Economists have been banking on an improved trade\nperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish\nCanadian economy.\n    They say the country\'s consumers, who have been spending at\na torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays\nthis year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into\nthe country.\n    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United\nStates, by far the country\'s largest market, is expected to be\nstrong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer\nspending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.\n    \"We maintain what\'s going to drive Canada\'s export\nperformance is income growth in the U.S.,\" said Midland\'s\nDonegan.\n    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist\nWarren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and\nsaid it could be a mistake to read too much into February\'s\ntrade upturn.\n    Jestin said, \"Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing\nsigns of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate\nthat part of the strength (in Canada\'s trade figures) is\nprobably transitory.\"\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents\na lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in\nFebruary last year following a sharp rise in international\nprices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.\n    In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,\nPresident Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said\nthey need to make hard commercial decisions. \"If we have failed\nat the ICO, at least we have tried,\" Dauster said, adding \"now it\nis time to go and sell coffee.\"\n    But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans\nto make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next\nmonth, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade\nsources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a\nprevious crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public\nselling tenders for coffee bought on London\'s futures market\nlast year.\n    A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the\nmarket \"in one go\" but is sold over a minimum of six months.\n    The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split\nbetween producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for\nfuture quotas. Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average\nexports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\nDauster said.\n    All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\nconsumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way\nof settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\nproducers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\n    Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\nnon-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\nthat Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\nratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\n    It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"\npolicy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\nto participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\ndifficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\ndifferent share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\n    Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\nand at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\n    Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\naccept the producers\' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\nimpossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\n    \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\nencourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\nsupplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\n    Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\nargument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\nsession but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\nand how much producers will sink their differences should\nprices fall further and remain depressed.\n    The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\nboth producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\nnegotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\nIndonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\n    More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\npolitics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\nbring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\nmany imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\nthe summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\nOctober are unlikely, while Brazil\'s Dauster noted the ICO has\ncontinued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\n    A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\nby importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\nhappy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\nnot be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could\nshow a direct relationship between quotas and availability.\n    In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the\nseemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to\nlapse should lasting agreement not be found.\n    \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their\nfailure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient\nand we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

The consumer position would have in effect reduced the\nmarket share of Brazil, by far the world\'s largest producer.\n    Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support\nlegislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.\ncustoms service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply\nwith any future coffee quotas.\n    He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the\ncoffee policy situation following the collapse of the London\ntalks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\"\n    However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee\npolicy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market\noffensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,\nto soften the consumer position.\n    \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will\nkind of want to test the resolve of other producers and\nconsumers,\" said one U.S. official.\n    The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said\nBrazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few\nmonths in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other\ncountries, particularly the splinter group of small producers\nwho differed with the major producers in London.\n    This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin\nAmerican countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the\nU.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in\nthe White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.\nofficials said.\n    The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee\npolicy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from\npolitically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.\nofficials said.\n    El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia\nat the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on\nobjective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica\njoined the splinter group, which said it would agree to\nobjective criteria.\n    There is a strong feeling among some in the State\nDepartment that the United States should continue to support\nthe splinter group of producers who have taken the\npolitically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective\ncriteria question, U.S. officials said.\n    Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be\nsome pressure to reassess positions.\n    In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the\nNetherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on\nthe issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.\n    This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations\nto successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.\n    However, U.S. sources said West Germany\'s support was at\ntimes qualified and there is some concern that the European\nCommunity could come under pressure to be more accommodative to\nproducers in future talks.

Analysts\nagreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they \ndiffered sharply over the carmaker\'s long term prospects.\n    \"I\'m very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder\nPeabody and Co. \"They\'re clearly committed to enhancing\nshareholder value.\"\n    However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the\nbuyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to\nrecapture lost market share.\n    After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy\nback 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The\nannouncement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,\nwith more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.\n    The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the\nstock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at\nleast one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a\ngood performance expected from new car models.\n    But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the\nrepurchase program is not a positive.\n    \"The buyback doesn\'t really change the earnings outlook and\nputs more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will\nhave to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock\nshould settle back down to around 76, he added.\n    Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and\n5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.\nHealy\'s numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,\nwhich range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four\ndlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.\n    Like other analysts, Healy sees GM\'s share of the domestic\ncar and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are\nnot selling as well as their competitors,\" he said.\n    In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the\nyear-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and\nChrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases.

The numbers include imports.\n    Kidder Peabody\'s Kirnan said cost reductions and product\nimprovements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the\nfourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.\n    \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it\'s rolling up\nits sleeves and getting serious.

./progs/weka-3-6-9/data/ReutersGrain-train.arff:'NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the\nyen\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact\nthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major\nEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate\ndistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.\n    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements\nby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the\ncurrency movements of the past two years are also creating a\nfundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new\ntrade tensions and imbalances.\n    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are\nalready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-\nEuropean Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.\n    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international\ncooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between\nthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down\nthe value of the dollar was a historic one.\n    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major\ncurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which\nthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not\nnecessarily central significance, the officials said.\n    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took\nplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar\'s peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don\'t expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\nand this year we may have to do so again,\" he said.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

Some of them are \"too sophisticated to\nconvert into financial terms,\" one banking source said.\n    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is\nimpossible to calculate.\n    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland\'s\neconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.\n    \"Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-\nachieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only\ncontributed to largely internal, economic problems,\" one said.\n    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured\nNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation\nfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under\nmartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was\noriginally devised several years ago by the Institute of\nNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planning\ncommission.\n    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish\neconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth\ntrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in\ncredits from Western commercial and government lenders.\n    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was\nbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing\nthe estimate as \"a theoretical projection based on a high point,\nwhich has no real scientific evaluation.\"\n    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to\nthe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs\nannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were\nimposed.\n    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to\n200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade\nsurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs\nagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.\n    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important\nU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,\nchemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits\ndried up for economic not political reasons.  \"Poland is\naccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for\npolitical reasons,\" said one expert. \"It\'s an illusion based on a\nmisunderstanding of Western economy.\"\n    \"There\'s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone\nwho has no hope of repaying it,\" another said, adding that\nPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits\nin the 1970s which were no longer today\'s reality.\n    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as \"nebulous,\" one\ndiplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders\nand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of\nscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the\nlifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact\non Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs\nand lacks the means to modernise its industry.\n    \"MFN doesn\'t really mean anything, only that Poland will not\nbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to\nregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are\nin play now,\" said one Western envoy.\n    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their\nquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist\nmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper\nPoland\'s efforts to regain entry.\n    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised\nthis fact recently.\n    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, \"Making\nup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly\ndifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of\ntwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level of\nexports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\"\n    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it\nhas a \"moral right\" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says\nimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said\n\"The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing\nof the Polish economy won\'t cut any ice. The Americans will\njust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing\nSolidarity.\"\n    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in\ntalks in Washington last week with the International Monetary\nFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was\nlooking for a lead from the United States.\n    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its\nfinancial obligations to the United States, \"but not in a short\ntime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its\nforeign economic partners.\"\n    He stressed that the U.S. \"had a particular opportunity to\nplay a part in the cooperative policy of Poland\'s partners\ninterested in the settlement of Polish debt.\"\n    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed\nWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and\nParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and\nsaid it should now play a more positive role.\n    \"As a major superpower the United States can influence\ninternational organisations,\" he said, citing recent meetings\naimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to\nwhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0

./progs/weka-3-6-9/data/ReutersGrain-train.arff:'NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN The highly visible drama involving the\nyen\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact\nthat the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major\nEuropean currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate\ndistortions, Japanese and European research officials said.\n    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements\nby the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the\ncurrency movements of the past two years are also creating a\nfundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new\ntrade tensions and imbalances.\n    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are\nalready changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-\nEuropean Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.\n    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international\ncooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between\nthe U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down\nthe value of the dollar was a historic one.\n    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major\ncurrency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which\nthe Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not\nnecessarily central significance, the officials said.\n    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took\nplace, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\n    \"You have to look at the dollar\'s peak compared with now,\nand that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\n    \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\nlaying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\n    \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\nedge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\nmy objective view, I don\'t expect a drastic improvement in our\ntrade imbalance.

This is when, traditionally, there is more demand\nfor gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria\"s.\n    The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela\nand Indonesia were having less problems with output than\nproducers like his own country because they exported oil\nproducts.\n    Also, some of Venezuela\"s heavy grades were outside the Opec\npricing system, he said.\n    Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift\nsome Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks\nand ran them down to \"dangerous levels,\" they would eventually\nhave to buy Opec oil.\n    \"When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market)\nthey will realise they should buy now instead of paying more\nlater on,\" he said.\n    Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being\npressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was\nimportant to know that terms with them were negotiable,\nflexible and under constant review, not only when the market\nseemed weak.\n    He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation\nministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that\nsuch a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority\nfor Opec at the moment.\n    \"At this time, we have to get our priorities right,\" he said.\n\"The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is\nworking, not dealing with a differential of cents between\ngrades.\"\n    But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over\nthe differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

./progs/weka-3-6-9/data/ReutersGrain-train.arff:'BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES This week\'s Bank of England resistance to\nstrong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in\nholding bank base rates at 11 pct.\n    But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the\nExchequer Nigel Lawson\'s policy, stated at the end of the Paris\nGroup of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling\nbroadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources\nsaid.\n    Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing\ntrade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the\nParis meeting and up 0.4 on the day.\n    Today\'s peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.\n    A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted\na substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is\ntherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.\n    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe\nLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see the\ntrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. \"Even after this action\nover the last few weeks, sterling\'s only just within striking\ndistance of that range,\" he said.\n    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some\nbroad target range around this area.\n    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the\npound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of\na loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.\n    \"If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they\nare, what\'s to stop it (going higher),\" said John Cox, executive\ndirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London\nforeign exchange market.\n    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active\nselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of\ngeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helped\nkeep it below 1.60 dlrs.\n    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and\n1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.\n    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling\nheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it\nholds around these levels.\n    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest\nrate boat. \"If rates don\'t come down, the market will say they\nought to have come down and will sell sterling,\" he said.\n    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of \"hot money\" being\ninvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight\nor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short\nnotice.\n    However, the authorities will hope that at least a\nproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.\n    \"The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and\nhave to jack them back up again,\" said Richard Jeffrey,\neconomist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.\n    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for\nsterling, at least in the near term.\n    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point\nabout March 17, Budget Day.\n    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the\nBudget, said Temperton.\n    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the\nrun-up to a general election, the major factor behind current\nbullishness in the government bond and currency markets.\n    \"Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.\nHe wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate\ncut,\" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the\nequities arm of Mercury International Group.\n    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the\nway lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in\nthe weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last\nFriday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.\n    This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11\n3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest\nsince base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.\n    However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months\nmoney, banking sources said the market could not take the cut\nas a guide to the Bank\'s intentions on short term rates.\n REUTER\n&#3;',0
